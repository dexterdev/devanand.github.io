I am a postdoctoral researcher at Ben-Gurion University, Israel. My current work focuses on applying machine learning techniques to study the "language" of facial expressions inspired by natural language processing(NLP) techniques. Previously, I did my Ph.D. in computational biophysics under the supervision of Dr. Satyavani Vemparala from The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai which is a research institute under the Department of Atomic Energy Department. Before my Ph.D., I did my B. Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (University of Calicut) and M.Tech in Electronics Design and Technology (National Institute of Technology, Calicut). Then I worked as a lecturer in Nehru Engineering college, Pampady for 17 months. And then switched to research. I have worked in the area of Computational Biophysics, specifically atomistic and coarse-grained classical molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules like proteins and lipids, etc. My field of interests includes Computational Neuroscience, AI, information theory, signal processing, complex systems, active matter, and other non-equilibrium physics which models "emergent phenomenon" in nature, etc.
