title: A facepalm moment from my lectureship days: A cos(theta) â†’ 'ga' evolution!
---

India has tonnes of engineering colleges. The small southernmost state of India, Kerala has around [150](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_engineering_colleges_in_Kerala) engineering institutes! There are few good colleges, but most of them are very low-quality institutes. 

After my Masters in Engineering, I started a teaching career in an Engineering college. I was enthusiastic about delivering my knowledge in electronics, but I was a bad teacher. I was unable to grab the attention of my restless students. Actually, my classes were like the fun time for them.

One day, an unexpected visitor came to my office cabin. She was a lecturer from CS(computer science) department. (Ours is Electronics and Communication department) This lady had to teach communication engineering to computer science students. She was very tensed.

She said she needs to clarify a doubt regarding the content in her notebook. I said okay and so she opened her notebook. And asked me what do we call this mathematical symbol?:![](https://i.imgur.com/TxUCFHR.png)

To be honest I haven't seen anything like this in math content before. There is an alphabet in malayalam like this. It is pronounced as 'ga'. I was sure it is not 'ga'. So I started reading the notebook. I found the complete equation was like this: ![](https://i.imgur.com/3wuiCOW.png)

exoft=A ga! WTF is this thing?

And suddenly a blub lighted up in my brain. This is not exoft=A ga! This is exoft=A cos(t)!

This equation appears several times in communication engineering. What it represents a sinusoid. If you want to represent a signal from an input point, we represent it using this sinusoid. The logic for using a sinusoid in place of any signal is the analysis of any composite signal will not be different, because any practical signal is a summation of sinusoids. What I stated is the Fourier theory naively. 
Let us get back to the story: what made our lady lecturer confusing? In my understanding this is what happened: Massive note copying is a culture ingrained in engineering colleges like this. Many students and teachers rely on other's notebooks. Rather than looking at the original textbooks, they prefer handwritten notes. And now this is like a generation of notes passed on! An evolution like below:

I think this incident is an eye-opener to the quality of teaching and learning in engineering institutes in India.
